At the elected official report, that's Councillor Williams. There we go. I'm going to, the elected official report is for Councillor Williams, so I'm going to turn the floor over to him for a moment. Yes, I will not be running in the fall municipal election. Yeah, he's unmuted, Councillor Fule. Overall, it's been a rewarding experience, but my life has moved on, and I can't say that I would be interested in putting a lot of time and effort into another four years. Thank you for that. Do you have any comments, council? Councillor Raulky, I'll start with you. Sure do. I just want to thank Peter from the bottom of my heart for all his good advice, his kind words, his soft tone, for all the advice, and offering me the opportunity to see the flip side of my thoughts. And for the good relations that we had during the four years, I thank you very much for that, Peter. Thank you. Councillor Bredin. Yeah, I'd like to really echo all the comments that Councillor Raulky said, I should have gone first, because then she could echo mine. But anyway, I do appreciate the camaraderie, the friendship, and Peter, who is always interested, or Councillor Williams, sorry, that has been interested in our local government for a lot of years, has done a lot of research and stuff, and that information helped me as a very newbie Councillor on a number of occasions. When he shared that wisdom with me, so I will miss him, and I hope our friendship continues, so. Councillor Fuel. Yeah, I just like to again to reassure that I thank working with you, Peter, and it's been an awesome time of four years, and you're experiencing the fire and water has definitely helped me learn more about the things that need to be done in the municipality to prove. Thank you. I also want to thank you, Councillor Williams. I've known you for a really long time, so it was lovely to have you on council, but your attention to detail, bringing forward things that are very important to the arm, but we're very passionate to you. We've worked hard on a lot of them, fire, our emergency services plan, bringing forward pieces of legislation to look at in regards to those aspects, and all the detailed reading you do into the reports to bring forward aspects that. Sometimes some of us look at things a different way as just been a very enjoyable experience. You're great to work with and seeing all sides of conversations and trying to understand where everybody's coming from. I'm looking forward to working with you for the next five and a half months to the next election too. We're not quite done yet. We'll still keep working hard. You've done a great job for the armist Springfield and as a group, we've worked really well together. It's been been a pleasure for the last almost four years, so I just want to say thank you as well. Thank all of you for your kind comments. Thank you, and we will move on to the question period. Is there anybody in the online gallery that has any questions regarding the agenda? If you could please unmute yourself and let me know which agenda item you would like to speak to. Thank you. I'd like to speak to item 9.1 first and then 4.1. Okay. I'm pleased to see the fundraising strategy for the community recreation center. It looks like people have been working. I guess behind the scenes from the general public. So that's nice that this has come forward. I just wondered how how does it fit into the financial plan that you are presenting like you're reading giving second and third reading to. In what way? Well, if they haven't started fundraising yet. No, but you reflected in the financial plan. Why wouldn't why wouldn't the estimated four million dollars of fundraising money be reflected somewhere in the budget? Well, it may be next year, but we haven't actually formally adopted this by council. So we wouldn't have reflected it in our financial plan. I guess that's the point is if you're going to adopt it and you're on the same day you're doing your financial plan, it would be nice if they kind of dovetailed. Because in this in this document, it says an estimated 20 million dollars for the recreation center. And in your financial plan, there's significantly more money sort of potentially being reflected. So it I guess let can we can we confirm that the estimated cost is 20 million that this report is correct in that. That is the price of the recreational center when we developed it. It might have changed by now. We'll have to see when it actually gets built. The isit funding actually covers between if we get full isit funding covers between 12 and 13 million dollars of the build. Do you have some fun set aside in reserves for the recreation center along with this fundraising of four million. So again, it depends on how much grant Monday is awarded to the RM for this project and that will determine how we fund everything else. So as I mentioned before, we have to put it in the financial plan. If we end up getting isit money, but how all it's all the funding levels are going to fall from other levels of government from fundraising from us. It's to be determined and I can't give any further answers other than that because I simply do not know. I guess like your campaign has started and so I guess I'm not going to be talking about well, no, I just want I want you to confirm that you're not going to proceed without substantial grant funding again you've said that before. Yeah, I've said it about 15 times now. So I'll say it again. This council is in 100% agreement that we need government funding from other levels of government to proceed with the full build of the recreational center. Then my confusion is that your financial plan isn't reflecting that. And I understand that's your opinion. We do we did have a financial manager who who worked on the budget and who liaise with the province who abides by piece that so you're getting your comments are taken under consideration how we are we have moved forward and we have adopted the financial plan based on the recommendation of our financial manager and the province. So I appreciate the comments. Do you have any other questions. Yes, will you confirm you will not start the project until I guess the fundraising is in place or alternative funding is in place. I've answered that question. I'm not answering that question again. If you would like to answer the question about the fundraising. I think I'm being very clear on the recreational center council will not move forward with building a recreational center. Unless we get grant support from other levels of government. It's that simple. I can't make it any more clear than that. But my question wasn't the next the last question wasn't about grant funding. It was about the fund raising and I'm letting you know this recreational center is contingent on being built on grant funding from other levels of government is not contingent on anything else. Okay, so my comment and then I will follow up with the last question, but it is that the general public are very concerned that other community centers have had to do fundraising. So I guess I'm happy to see that this this document is here. I'm happy to to know that there's going to be local fundraising and oak bank and area for this project. Unless you commit to it, like you committed to say cook's Creek. We're not we're not being. You'll just have to follow along with council for updates that we get from the fundraising committee and the fundraising committee was commissioned last year. You'll have to continue following long on agendas to find out when there's updates for the public on their fundraising progress. Do you have any other questions. But that wasn't the answer to my question. I'm sorry. I'm answering your question. Do you have any other questions? Okay, so what you're you're basically saying is the citizens have no say in this anymore. Council's going to do what they want. They're not committing to local fundraising to appease the public's need. I'm not saying that it's going to only be. I'm not saying any of that, but council Rokie, did you have a comment or an answer? I think I just I'm hoping to understand where. So we wouldn't be able to put a fundraising committee who is in it. Of their own accord working for our community and citizens. Because strange things can happen pandemics can happen. You can predict that everything is going to come to fruition based upon the timeline that is placed within your fundraising plan. So a NOLA community club had to do their own fundraising. They didn't have anybody supporting it. We did it on our own. We came to council council then said we'll do a third third third back then. That's many years ago. So if if we could get the commitment from one government. So it was only when the province and the feds had decided to put money in together. That then the RM supported that with the third third third function. And then we still as a fundraising committee on our own still had to put that money forward as well. Because then the project would not go forth. So we had to continue or start our programming first, our fundraising, our events. But I have to be honest with you, one event could take place and we'd make $3. Because it did not go over well. Meanwhile, I had predicted we would do 9,000. So then you get a constantly be moving and changing and coming up with different plans and ideas for what you're going to do for your fundraising. So I couldn't ask anybody to go ahead and commit and say you're going to back my four million or my one million when it's up to me to achieve that. And it's up to every citizen in this community and not only Oakbank area. It's all of the municipality who's going to benefit from this. So we can go out toward four and we can go out to cook to creak and we can go everywhere. And everybody in there is going to have a benefit to using this facility. So I don't know if that helps, but that's I'm thinking one of the questions you had asked is to why it wouldn't be there. I'm saying it can't be until we get that committee started and moving and our first event or their first event taking place. I'm going to start to see if they're meeting those criteria, as well as the donations that need to come in based upon what we read in that report. Thank you, Councillor Raulke. Hope that helps. Do you have any other comments or question, Janet? Can I respond to that please? Because it was very helpful and that was the the concept that I was trying to express is that with an allah and with with cooks creak. It was a commitment by the public to do fundraising. Now council has never said pardon. That's what this document is. No, and this is what they're offering to do for the community. I agree. I'm happy to see it. But what I'm asking from council is that that you are going to not. I'm going to make the same kind of assurances that previous council has said that we need the community to get behind this. We're not going to just pay this by grants and taxes. Okay, so of course we want to get the community behind this. The community has said they wanted fundraising. There's now a fundraising plan in place. But that's as far as I'll go. There's a fundraising plan in place. These people are energetic. And if you're concerned about fundraising, my advice you would be to actually give them a call. I'm looking for representatives and help fundraiser fundraising is a concern. They're always looking for people who want to be involved in the community to help out. We'll be lovely for you to do that. And anybody else in Springfield. Is there any other questions or comments? No, thank you. Is there anybody else online that has any questions or comments for the upcoming agenda? We will move on to Baila 22-14. Can I have a mover in a seconder, please? Councilor Raulke, Councilor Burdeen. It resolved that second reading be given to Baila No. 22-14, being a Baila of the Army Springfield to establish rates of taxation and imposed taxes for 2022. Thank you, is there any further discussion from council? All those in favor? Thank you. Thank you. Is there any further discussion from council all those in favor. Carey 5 0 is our delegation. I don't see. Kate will just move on until we can confirm we have our consent agenda which has the recreation funding plan under there. Can I have a mover and a seconder, please. Councillor Raulke, Councillor Verdeen. Whereas a consent agenda has been submitted consisting of two items be resolved at the said consent agenda be received disinformation. Thank you. Is there anything that needs to be discussed or pulled out for Councillor fuel. Yeah, I just like to add that once again what the mayor said that funding will also come from other governments. We're not just going to be doing this on our own that the funding does have to come from other province or the federal government. And the fundraising on top of that. So to this council will not be financing this whole project on its own. Thank you, Councillor Raulke. And yes, I love the aspect of having that fundraising committee going to all the citizens in the RM to support it. And because it is going to be a facet and a like I almost like a calculated. Calculation that says, you know, here's one facet of funding. Here's another one and here's a third one. That's exactly what it'll be. And I understand that is really important to get the community behind this. It's really important to get every citizen buying into it. It is very, very important for everybody to understand that this is for all of us. It's not just for some of us. And it is going to be very successful if we get that in mind and if people buy into it literally by fundraising. So I am really, really looking forward to this and I can't think that committee for working hard enough. Thank you. I just want to actually thank the committee members that have stepped up and volunteered in the community. The work is really appreciated. It's a big job to create a plan and to work on a plan and fundraise. It doesn't go unnoticed. And if you do have questions about fundraising, I would encourage you. If you'd like to get involved or you want to do more community. Just be involved in the community more. This is a great way way to do that. The information is on the website under the agenda or you can call our community services department. They will help you to get involved with the fundraising. All those in favor carried five zero. Next we have the Manitoba Association of Municipal Emergency Coordinator Conference on June 7th. Can I have a mover and a seconder? Can I have a mover and a seconder please? Thank you. Thank you. All those in favor. All those in favor. Three five zero. We have our land sale resolutions. Can I have a mover and a seconder please? Councilor Fule. Councilor Raulke. We resolve the Council of the Armageddon Springfield deems roll 61300 to be surplus land and authorizes the sale to Wayne ED at the current assessed value. We get further resolved that the purchaser be responsible for all costs associated with the transfer of the land. Thank you. I'd also like to know. Council has created in conjunction with administration a land sale reserve so that when land is sold in the RM, the funds from those sales go into the land sale reserve. And when we do need to buy land for things like drainage projects or retention projects, we can use that funding from that land sale reserve to purchase new land for projects important to the constituency. Is there any other comments or questions from council? All those in favor carried five zero. Next we have the list of accounts. Can I have a mover and a seconder please? Councilor Fule.

All those in favor carried five zero. We will go back to our assessment tax impact presentation. If you could, hi, if you could come up to the mic please. That would be great and then we'll get everybody to meet. Thank you. Apologies, I was delayed by a little bit of construction in law court. But. Thank you so much. It's totally be 10 minutes and ended up being half an hour. So anyone's heading on in that direction. You've gotten your. So I have two separate presentations and I can go through. Perhaps the tax impact one first. So I'm going to go through. I'm going to go through our aerial image project that we just completed over the winter that. I was pretty interesting in terms of its impact. So. Yes, why are we here today? We did this time around. So we're doing it three years after our last. Reassessment. Our last assessment was based on April 1st, 2018 reference date. And the new reassessment will be based on April 1st, 2021 reference date. So we're, we're seeing an adjustment to the assessment over a three year time period. Whereas it's been every two years up until recently. It's how do we arrive at that number? Are those numbers? Every time a property sells, we go and we review those sales. A lot of that we review through a keystone matrix, which is the realtor database. But with lots of farm sales, for example, we have to do a lot more digging. With commercial sales, that sort of thing. There's a lot more research done in our part. And so our staff do verify every single sale that happens. We verify every single sale we try to contact every single one of the sales that aren't sold through keystone matrix. So in between April 1st, 2018 and April 1st, 2021, there were 1,311 sales in Springfield. And so we go to a verification process and the reason we do that is sometimes you'll have dollar sales, which are not true transactions value. Sometimes you'll have forced sales where someone had to dump a property below its market. Sometimes you have people that come along and pay way too much for a property, which last couple of months, you might think is every property, but that's just the market. And so once we go through that verification process, when we remove the highs and the lows and those invalid sales, we're left with 933 sales that were used in arriving at the assessments for. For for the all the properties in the RM so roughly about 12% of the properties that sold were used in arriving at the reassessment values for for everyone. And I always like to highlight some of the highest sales just just for council's interest. So in that three or time period, there were 34 properties that sold for in excess of a million dollars. And the majority were commercial parcels or development sales. And so that's that seems to be where most of the activity has been in the farm component is also extremely strong at the moment. So you know, it's funny, the lowest sale or not the usually our residential sales and a lot of these meetings are the highest ones, but that's not the case in the arm of Springfield or highest residential sale when I say residential. First of the land with house purchased for the highest and best use as home to live in our highest sale was 1.29 million in the arm of Springfield. So that's up to April 1st 2021. There's been a lot of market activity since and all those sales will be used for our next reassessment will be based on April 1st 2023 market values. So that's a little commentary on the market. Today in the mail, we have just over 8700 reassessment notices that are going out in the mail and some of your emails or your may start getting lots of calls about it. That's our problem. We need to answer to those property owners. And if they have any questions or concerns, we'll be trying to address those when those notices come out. A couple more things. So once those notices are sent out and let's say people aren't happy, we do try to talk with everyone and explain why the value has changed doesn't always go up sometimes it goes down, we try to explain that. And if people aren't happy, they do have the right to appeal at the end of the process, but that's usually the last step. If we can do anything to make it to address the person's concerns or relook at a property we will and the assessment process is always the last step. And just for your information last year, there are total 14 appeals for the arm of Springfield, which is pretty low. We've got 8700 properties, but we've had years where we have 200 appeals and three days worth of appeal hearing. So hopefully that doesn't happen this year, but that that may happen. So perhaps I'll get into the actual report now. And if there are any questions as I'm going along, please fire away. I won't go through the report word for word, but there's there's three pages that I typically focus on and that's the ones with all the numbers on pages two, four and five. Page two is the one that outlines the big impact of the reassessment. So province wide, the total assessment base is going up 10%. So if you add up all the 136 municipalities in Manitoba take out. And average it all out 10%. In the case of the arm of Springfield, the average increases 15% or just over 15% or 217 million dollars is being added to the tax base for the 2023 year. And that's driven by a few things changes to demand and supply for property, new construction and improvements to existing properties and the improvements to existing properties. So we found a lot of that with our recent project over the winter using aerial imagery. So we'll be talking about that a little bit later. So now, not every property goes up exactly 15%. Some go up more and some go up less. And at the bottom of the page two on the right hand side, it shows you the percentage change in each property class. Looking at single family residential average single family residential assessment is increasing by 15.5%. Last reassessment, that was 1.8%. So that's that's pretty big jump. But again, this is over a three year period and last time was over a two year period. The apartment, so your multifamily would be up about 7.6% and your condos, which seem to be lagging a bit behind or two and a half percent. That's a lot of that is in this pandemic. It seems like everybody wanted a backyard room to run around and the condos with their small yards and that sort of thing weren't as popular. The big winner, depending on how you look at it, is farm property. Average assessment is going up 30.3%. So that's continuing a trend. And that's that's not a note wire for Springfield. That's consistently through all the province FCC has confirmed that with their own sales investigation and that's, and that's pretty big last time it was 13.3% that the farm line went up. So that's looking at all class 30 or assessed property. So I don't have a breakdown of the building and land component, but I would venture to guess the majority that would be the land portion. So your farmland and we've had just looking at some municipalities, I was looking at another municipality that had 16 sales and excess of a million dollars every single one of them was a farm sale. And, you know, it's, you know, Springfield's a unique municipality and its size, you use right next to the city, but there's a huge agricultural component as well. And we don't always necessarily have lots of sales within a specific neighborhood, but the trend throughout the region has seen big jumps. Sometimes you have buyers coming from outside of the area, we've seen some municipalities or buyers are coming in from Southern Manitoba buying up land. And of course, the supply of land isn't, isn't increasing. So in that meeting of demand and supply, it's definitely being driven by the demand for land. And now again, you know, since April 2021, that could change, but this has definitely been a trend that has continued. The commercial components up about 11.2%. And then the institutional pipeline and rail away are not as as increasing in line with the other portions, but the big increases are in your farm and to a certain extent, the residential. And that's because an assessment increases by 15% doesn't mean the taxes will increase by 15% next year, and so that's another thing to consider. So that's another thing that we look at in this report. So on the page four of the report, what we do is we take a look at what's that impact on everyone's bottom line tax bill. Part of page four is a bit of a rose colored glass perspective. So we're taking, we're presuming your budget for 2023 is identical to what it was in 2022. And last night, my check inflation numbers, I think around 6, 7%. So we know your budget for 2023 will not be exact to this year. And then when you factor in the school division, that has a huge impact as well. So, but if we're looking at the average, so if you had to raise exact same amount of money next year, how does that look? So in the case of a person that has a 15.5% average residential property, they would see their taxes increased by 1.2% in a perfect world. I don't live in a perfect world. I don't think anyone here does. So it's most likely going to be a bit more than that. How much that's that's I guess depends on I guess a budgetary constraints, but that's the projection. The apartments, we see a bit of a decrease, the condo property owners, we see a decrease there as well. The one where there is a bit of an increase is with the farm. So that 30% assessment increase, that same person would see about a 14% tax increase in this perfect world scenario and most likely be a bit more than that. And all the other property classes, you see a bit of a decrease and everyone asked me what's designated recreational that one at the bottom, that's your golf courses and that's just an economic reality. They're not as it's a small portion of your tax base, but also golf courses aren't exactly selling for lots of money these days. So at the bottom of page four is this pie chart and talks about the number of properties with increases and the number of properties decreases. And again, it's assuming that perfect world scenario and here it's showing about 60% of property seeing a tax increase next year and 40% seeing a decrease, most likely be more than that 60%. So that's that's that's a reality of this reassessment. We look only at the municipal portion. If we take the school divisions out and we only look at the municipal levies, that's addresses on page five. You take that same single family residential property with a 15 and a half percent assessment increase, we're seeing a 0.2% of the tax increase again in that perfect world scenario. And you see all the other properties except for the farm dropping so, but the farm will definitely be seeing an upward adjustment with the taxes next year. There are a couple items. I mean, there are options to municipalities to mitigate tax shifts. If if you want to. I haven't seen a case where they have been implemented and those are on page six where we talk about phasing and increases and decreases varying property class percentages establishing tax credit programs. Those are all tools available to municipality. They're not often used. But if that was something that council would consider, you'd be advised to reach out to an MSO officer and help you through that process. One thing that will you will likely get calls about is the education property school tax rebate. Last year, for the first time, a lot of people got bonus check in the mail and what that check was, it was a 25% of the school tax says that you have paid on your property tax bill. If you own a residential or farm property, I'm going to say a commercial property was 10% of the total school tax portion. So in this year's provincial budget, it was announced that that would be increasing to 37.5% of the education school tax amount. And that again will come in the form of a check. Now, there will be a bit of a reduction in the homeowners property tax credit. So last year, it was reduced from $700 to five and a quarter. And this year, it's been reduced to $438. But then there's going to be that check that comes out. Overall, there's probably a bit of a reduction to people's taxes as a result of that. Next year, that credit, that check is supposed to go up to 50% of the school taxes that you pay. So if you're paying $2,000 in school taxes on your property tax bill, $1,000 are becoming back on the form of a check. Yep. So if the province is sending out rebays for education tax or school tax, when is the actual school tax amount on tax bills going to change? That I haven't heard any announcement on. So you're talking about just removing it altogether off the tax bill. Well, when we were when I was thinking about this, like every year, the room, they're sending back 25% right 25 than 50 that 75 100. If they're sending back that rebate, why isn't that same percentage reflected on the education taxes? Or is it at the end of year four, then all of a sudden you're not going to be paying school taxes at all? They haven't been clear with how the program actually works that I've seen from any of our correspondences with the province. I'll try to get more clear clarification on that. Thank you. I haven't seen anything that's more clear and I haven't heard of them going to 100% either. I've heard it go up to 50%. I think their intention is to take it right off the tax bill. That's what I that's what I had heard. But again, I would like clarification. If you could get that, that would be great. All of I know all of council would like to see that so. And probably administration. For sure. So there are a couple of ways people can get a hold of us. So we have an updated website and with all those reassessment notices that are sent out. It's, there's a, every property owner can create their own password and ID. And you can go and look at your own property assessment information when that comes in the mail. But invariably, the more information you provide will typically generate more questions. So property owners can contact us through our assessment inbox and we'll reply to those as quickly as we can. People can still continue to call our office with their questions. We are having an open house in the Springfield RM as well. And we're having open houses across the province. So if a person can't come to the open house in Springfield will be, you know, any St Paul being broken head will be through all to all their region meeting with property owners if they want. And we're also doing a virtual inspections with people if they'd like where designated one night a week where someone wants to make an appointment to talk with an assessor they can do that. So if they nights in our office, they contact our office and we'll meet through teams or zoom with property owners and try to communicate that one of those open houses could be promoted on the website for the municipality that they're very, very helpful. Sometimes we come out and no one shows up and other times busy, but we'd rather see more people come than the no one at all. That's not right. So, so very hopeful that we get some feedback on that. So any other questions on the tax impact report itself. We don't break it down because there's there is no average host in in Springfield per se. I mean, we could certainly run a report of assessments 8 to Z and pick that number in the middle and see what the average assessment is, but there's extremely wide wide range. Last year, and I'll move on to our picked on aerial imagery discussion. Last May, we had some Cessna airplanes flying around the Springfield broken head in Belziger, and they had six cameras attached to the bottom of them and they were taking aerial images of the whole municipality, not the whole municipality, the majority of the municipality. The reason we do that is in the past, we used to do door to door inspections of all properties. That's an extremely slow process, where we would be able to do five inspections a day using going out door to door meeting with owners using the virtual tool, we can do 14 properties a day. So our department had been audited the number of years ago, and there's a standard in assessment that's recognized by the association of assessors out of the US, where there's a standard where in the perfect world, every property would be touched by our staff every eight years, and every bear land parcel will be touched every 12 years. It's just to ensure fairness and equity and assessments. So because, you know, as much as we believe everyone takes out a permit every time they build an addition or make a change, it doesn't always happen. What we often find is those honest people that take permits, we go and we visit those and the people that aren't taking permits for changes, we don't visit as much. So that's why we have these reinspection policies where we go and we view as many properties as possible. It's extremely expensive to apply municipality. And so you can't do every single role we'd love to, but we can't. But in the case of Springfield, we flew 6,965 properties. So about three quarters of the municipality was flown last year. And so what we did over the course of the winter is we reviewed those images and the provider we use is a company out of the West called the Eagle view. And in our presentation, you could see there's a number of tools that we can use. We can zoom in on a property. We could look at it from five different angles. We can measure heights with length. When we fly again in eight years, which is our intent, we'll have change recognition software embedded into the imagery. So we'll be able to see if there's been changes to a property much, much more quickly. This is a great tool for assessment. It's also sharing that assessments are fair and equitable. And often we get swings and value as a result of that. And so this past project, we impacted assessments by just over 98 million dollars in Springfield. We're about $14,000 to $114 per roll as a result of this aerial imagery project. And we can easily identify things like decks, sheds, shops. We found a couple homes that weren't assessed previously. So pretty major. But there's also things that have been removed from properties as well. Or perhaps there was a structure, but it's deemed to have no value. You know, you have the farm building where the roof is caving in. Well, that's, it's not insured anymore. There's no value on that. So those we would remove off the assessment. And it helps level the playing field in terms of value. And that'll have a bit of an impact for sure with the phone calls we get. Whenever we do one of these projects, we do get more phone calls to our office because there are often shifts and value. But once we explain why these changes have happened, typically, you know, people understand why it may not like it, but it's where our mandates to be assess a market value. That's what we're trying to do with those images. So it's a tool that we use and it's a huge enhancement to what we do. We're able to touch more properties to assess more properties and do it more efficiently as well. Those images are available to the RM as well. So for a much lower cost than what it costs assessment services. So if the RM was interested in I've shared the information you can contact our provider, they may have a number of licenses that they could provide to the RM for a fee. So not just for assessment purposes, fire, police, byline, forcements, building inspectors could all use those images quite well. And it's a great tool to use. And if you put it side by side, say with a Google image, there's no difference. The quality, the resolution quality is much better with the imagery of getting through Eagle view. There's a cost to that and we've paid that cost and it is available to Ms. Polly, if you want. Not from us, but from the provider. There's the two. There's the oblique and the overtop as well. Peter, I think you're muted. Thank you. And I guess what you cannot capture is any internal improvements like finishing a basement. Okay, so I was going to ask about that. That's not a consideration now that we've chosen to go this method, which is, of course, more efficient and stuff. And if you say, you don't know what's in my basement. That is, that's true. We were not getting inside. And to be honest, even when we go out and inspecting, you know, your chances of getting into a property or not that great to begin with, you know, typically when a house is first built or structures first built, you're more likely to get in. But once it's built, it's pretty hard, you know, with just being able to contact people and it's not like we're right next door. That was the only reason why we kept our blinds closed was because the assessors. Although, if you see the imagery, it's pretty, pretty good. You can't see through windows. And I know some people might think it's, it's a bit, big brother. And that's, you may feel that way, but, you know, we're, we're like that referee that's got to make the call. And, you know, not everyone likes it when you call that hooking pounding. But if it's a hook, it's a hook. So. Awesome. How we close. I'm the aerial imagery. We've done seven of these projects now. And, you know, I believe in the case of the city of Brandon, they, they were so impressed with the imagery. They might not bought it themselves, you know, separate from us. So it's, it doesn't provide street view imagery, which we wish we could have. But what we do is each summer, we hire step students that do that. So we'll go and they'll take photos. But it's again, there's 93,000 properties in our district. They're not going to take a picture of every property. It's the ones that we don't get it to. It's this picture that's on the screen right now. You showing that to show if there's a side yard violation. Well, I want to would appear to be. It actually doesn't have the change recognition yet. It's showing that a line of the structure, but the city of one and pick, for example, has used it a couple times now. And they do have the, they are noticing the changes. So it's a tremendous tool. It's going to be interesting. There's supposed to start flying within the next week or two might see flood damage. We're not flying Springfield this year, but the municipalities where we are flying, that's something that you might be able to know as well. For the questions. Stinger missiles being in that you guys are aware of. I'm not we know of. But it's like when they see the plane. It's how there's that joke. We always see, you know, how the real estate agencies are property, how your praise your season. We're just trying to make sure the values are fair. And when people don't think they're fair, they can appeal. And as we all experience this year, I mean, sometimes people, you know, they will. They go to municipal board hearings and that's the right for sure. Is there any other questions from council other than thanking you for coming in and giving us that presentation. And for offering to get back to us without some of that school division information. So thank you. Thank you. Take care. Thanks. Yes, we added the council meeting schedule.
